# Find Program

## Overview

Welcome to the Find Program! This C++ program is designed to search for a character or string within another string. The program provides a user-friendly interface for inputting a sentence and the desired character or string to find, then displays the results.

## Features

- **Character Search:**
  - Displays the position(s) of a character in the sentence.

- **String Search:**
  - Indicates whether the specified string is present in the sentence and displays its position.

- **Multiple Occurrences:**
  - For character searches, the program can display multiple locations if the character appears more than once.

## Test Runs

The program has undergone extensive testing to ensure its correct functionality. Various test cases cover different scenarios, including single characters, strings, and different sentence structures.

1. Single Character Search
   - User searches for a single character in a sentence.
   - Program displays the position(s) of the character.

2. String Search
   - User searches for a string in a sentence.
   - Program indicates whether the string is present and displays its position.

3. Multiple Occurrences
   - User searches for a character with multiple occurrences in a sentence.
   - The program displays all positions of the character.

## Code Organization

All the code for this project is located in the accompanying PDF file named `Barron-Jose-find.pdf`. The document is structured to be read from left to right, providing a detailed explanation of the code, 
its functions, and the rationale behind design decisions.

The code for this program is organized into three main files:

- `input_prot.h`: Header file containing inline functions for input validation.
- `strextra.h`: Header file with inline functions for string manipulation and searching.
- `find.cpp`: Main program file where the user interacts with the program.

## Skills Showcase

This project demonstrates proficiency in several key areas:

- **C++ Programming:**
  - Utilizes C++ language features, including object-oriented principles, to implement the core functionality of the Find Program.
  - Demonstrates a solid understanding of C++ concepts such as functions, data types, and control structures.

- **Problem Solving:**
  - Addresses the challenge of efficiently searching for characters or strings within a given sentence.
  - Implements solutions for handling different input scenarios and providing meaningful output to the user.

- **Documentation:** The accompanying PDF provides clear and detailed documentation, explaining the code's functionality, usage, and design choices.

- **Testing:**
  - Underwent thorough testing with various test cases to ensure robustness and correctness.
  - Test scenarios include single-character searches, string searches, and cases with multiple occurrences.
  - Validates the reliability of the program under different input conditions.

These skills collectively showcase the ability to design, implement, and document a C++ program that effectively addresses a specific problem domain.
